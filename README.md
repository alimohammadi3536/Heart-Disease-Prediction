# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project that uses data analysis and prediction techniques to assess the likelihood of heart disease in patients. 

The dataset includes various health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The goal is to train a model that can predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease, helping healthcare professionals make early interventions. The project uses Logistic Regression for classification and includes data visualizations for deeper insights.


Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a heart disease dataset containing various features collected from patients, including:

Age: The age of the patient.
Sex: The sex of the patient (male or female).
Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient.
Resting Blood Pressure: The blood pressure at rest.
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level.
Fasting Blood Sugar: Whether the patient's fasting blood sugar level is greater than 120 mg/dl.
Resting Electrocardiographic Results: ECG results during rest.
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate during exercise.
Exercise Induced Angina: Whether exercise induced angina was observed.
Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
Number of Major Vessels: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
Thalassemia: A blood disorder affecting red blood cells.
Target: Whether or not the patient has heart disease (1 for disease, 0 for no disease).
